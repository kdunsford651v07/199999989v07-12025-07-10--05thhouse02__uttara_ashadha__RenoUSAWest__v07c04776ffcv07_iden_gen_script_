Media, apps, services, websites, are all more power-dominated than ever before. When algorithms out of our control shape our social connection recommendations and content feeds, more needed than ever an open data protocol built off truth and trust, but how do we get there? What does it mean for my identity to be secure? Nowadays we're told that we need long passwords, multiple backups, and Bitcoin addresses. For just us to have a better daily life, this sounds like too much to be worth the time and hassle. Even if I was willing, around me are moms, aunts, uncles, community members, people around me, people in my government, et cetera, who will struggle trying to grasp public-private key cryptography right away, but I know with time they can learn. There needs to be a bridge, a gateway to this new world of understanding. We want better online identity: online social connection presupposes a net of identities, a net of presences. In 2025, most names are claimed across apps including social media platforms and domain name sellers. It's not easy to tell if someone I come across online is "on my team", meaning in support of digital collaboration and connection and freedom. I want a bridge to a new unexplored digital world, where the people who come along with me can also return home with the same bridge and bring more people with them to the promised land. ---- ---- Problem ---- Social media platforms have conflicts of interest discouraging user freedom and flexibility. As public companies they’re inclined to maximize shareholder value by locking in their users to drive revenue. The internet itself is an open place and the misalignment of the “fake internet” we all use today is clear and apparent. If we can’t fully exist on a new open secure protocol, we can’t extend and reify our tools, our personal brands, and our quality of connection. ---- ---- Approach ---- v07 is a reset to the entire namespace of the internet. By simply appending “v07” to just about every and any username on the internet -– from your personal name to your alternative name to your organization name or publication name -– you can likely claim unambiguous ownership of usernames and domains across nearly all internet platforms and levels. The design choice of the v07 username suffix offers flexibility for internationalization and artistry in a short, succinct, virtually unambiguous pronounceable way. The benefit also extends to choices of names for content delivery network providers and internet libraries. ---- ---- """" –--- –--- –---
